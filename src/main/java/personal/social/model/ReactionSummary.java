/**
 * Represents the aggregate summary of reactions (like, dislike, report, share)
 * for a specific {@link FeedItem} (either a post or a comment).

 * <p>This entity is used to efficiently store and query total reaction counts
 * for each feed item without having to compute them dynamically from individual user reactions.</p>
 *
 * <p>Fields:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code itemType} - The type of the associated item: POST or COMMENT.</li>
 *   <li>{@code feedItem} - The associated {@link FeedItem} (either post or comment) to which the reactions apply.</li>
 *   <li>{@code likes} - Total number of "like" reactions.</li>
 *   <li>{@code dislikes} - Total number of "dislike" reactions.</li>
 *   <li>{@code reports} - Total number of "report" reactions (usually for abuse or inappropriate content).</li>
 *   <li>{@code shares} - Total number of times the content has been shared.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This class is mapped to the database table {@code reaction_aggregate}.</p>
